$ITEM_NAME "Education and Health Rebalance (experimental)"
 
$ITEM_DESC "This mod changes the way education and healthcare work in the game, making it harder.

1. Children have to go to school until they turn 18, which increases demand for schools and makes bigger schools more useful.
2. University students cannot graduate until they turn 21.
3. Seriously ill people stay at hospital for a much longer (and random) period.
4. Seasonal diseases spread in colder months, greatly increasing healthcare demand in the winter, which makes bigger clinics and hospitals more useful.

In order to activate this mod, click on the Scripts button on the left-hand side of the screen. You can also turn the script off.

This requires further testing and balancing.

Warning: If you reload your game without quitting the game or at least returning to the main menu, the script will be duplicated. If this happens, simply run the turn off script until you are only running one instance.
